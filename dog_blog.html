    <h1>Hi World</h1>
      <h2>Monday</h2>
        <p>Today my parents went to work, so I had the house all to myself. I laid on the couch - and no one could get mad at me. I even figured out how to turn on Animal Planet!</p>
      <h2>Tuesday</h2>
        <p>Another lazy day. I might go outside tomorrow but the Animal Planet was just too good today.</p>
      <h2>Wednesday</h2>
        <p>Today is hump day, so my friend Camel came over.</p>
      <h2>Thursday</h2>
        <p>My favorite toys</p>
          <ol>
            <li>Rope</li>
            <li>Chewy Toy</li>
            <li>Frisbee</li>
         </ol>
      <h2>Friday</h2>
        <p>Hello!</p>
        <p>Hello!</p>
        <p>Hello!</p>
